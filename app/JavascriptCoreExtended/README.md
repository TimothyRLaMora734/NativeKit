# JavaScriptCoreExtended

This project is an extention to the normal MacOS/IOS JavaScriptCore to make it act more like a NodeJS environment. It was developed for use with [NativeKit](https://github.com/oscartbeaumont/NativeKit).

## Supported Node Features

- Console support (`console.log`, `console.debug`, `console.error`)
- Timeouts (`setTimeout`, `clearTimeout`, `setInterval`, `clearInterval`)
